    <p><b>Project: Fruit Ninja Game</b></p>
    <p>I coded a replica of fruit ninja using Python. I created groups for multiple fruits and a bomb and put them in a list. I iterate through that list dropping each fruit and a bomb at random spots at different speeds. If you click on a fruit you get a point, if you click on a bomb, you lose 2 points. If you reach 20 points you win. I made it so that if you click the space bar you can restart after losing or winning.</p>
    <p><b>Project: Wedding Usher Planner</b></p>
    <p>I coded a Wedding Usher planner using Python. I created multiple if statements checking first if you’re a friend or a family. After passing either, I use elif statements checking if you're a friend of the bride, friend of the groom, or friend of the bride and groom. If you’re family you sit in the front no matter who you're friends with to. If you're a friend of the bride, you sit on the left, a friend of the groom sits on the right, and a friend of both the bride and the groom sits in the front. </p>

    <p><b>Project: Pizza Order</b></p>
    <a href="pizza.html">Pizza Order Page</a>
    <p>I coded a pizza-ordering webpage using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I used HTML to create the structure of the webpage which includes input fields for the user to put their personal information like their name, address, and card information. There are radio buttons to pick your pizza size, type of crust, and flavor, and there’s a price next to each choice. There’s a submit button to place the order and display a summary of the order. JavaScript was used to process what was put into the pizza order like the input fields and what radio buttons were chosen and display the order summary. Clicking the submit button will calculate the total price depending on what choices were picked, display their selected choices with their corresponding pictures, and display a summary of their order with their personal information. Once the submit button is clicked another button called new order will be displayed and clicking it will reload the page resetting the form. I used CSS to change the font and color of the text that is displayed, adjust the height and width of the input fields, submit button, and new order button. I also used CSS to control the display of the new order button and certain text to be hidden first and then visible when necessary. </p>
    <p><b>Project: Rock Paper Scissors</b></p>
    <a href="rps.html">Rock Paper Scissors Page</a>
    <p>I coded a rock-paper-scissors game using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I used HTML to create the structure of the webpage displaying rock, paper, and scissor buttons, the CPU choice, and three headings displaying wins, losses, and ties. I used JavaScript to define variables for the counters of the three headings and the CPU choice. I created a CPU function, rock function, paper function, and scissor function. The CPU function randomly selects one of the three options (rock, paper, or scissors). The rock, paper, and scissor functions are used when the user clicks on the buttons. The three button functions each call the CPU function to get the CPU’s choice and display the choice. Then it compares the user’s choice with the CPU’s choice and increases the counter accordingly. The way the game works is simple, rock beats scissors. paper beats rock, and scissors beat paper. So every time a user clicks one of the buttons, the CPU choice will display and the counter headings will be updated based on who won between the CPU and user. I used CSS to make the webpage look better by changing the color of the headers (wins, losses, ties) and setting the images to a certain size. </p>
